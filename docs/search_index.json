Hence, if you are starting to read this book, we assume you have a working knowledge of how to use R.

GOSemSim: an R package for measuring semantic similarity among GO terms and gene products. Bioinformatics. 2010, 26(7):976-978. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btq064 Book structure Part 1 (Semantic similarity analysis) describes GOSemSim, DOSE and meshes packages for measuring semantic similarity of genes or gene products based on Gene Ontology, Disease Ontology and Medical Subject Headings. Part 2 (Enrichment analysis) introduces over-reprensentation analysis and gene set enrichment analysis using clusterProfiler (supports GO, KEGG, MSigDb, WikiPathway, and many others via universal interface), DOSE (DO, Disease-Gene Network, Network of Cancer Genes), meshes (MeSH), and ReactomePA (Reactome pathway). Functional enrichment analysis of Genomic coordination is supported via ChIPseeker and comparison among multiple conditions is also supported by clusterProfiler. We implemented a number of visualization methods in the enrichplot package to help users to interpret their results. Part 3 (Miscellaneous topics) describes useful utilities including translating gene IDs and manipulating enrichment results. Want to help?
