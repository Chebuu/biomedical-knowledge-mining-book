## How to prepare your own geneList {#genelist}

GSEA analysis requires a ranked gene list, which contains three features:


+ numeric vector: fold change or other type of numerical variable
+ named vector: every number has a name, the corresponding gene ID
+ sorted vector: number should be sorted in decreasing order


If you import your data from a `csv` file, the file should contains two columns, one for gene ID (no duplicated ID allowed) and another one for fold change. You can prepare your own `geneList` via the following command:


```r
d = read.csv(your_csv_file)
## assume 1st column is ID
## 2nd column is FC

## feature 1: numeric vector
geneList = d[,2]

## feature 2: named vector
names(geneList) = as.character(d[,1])

## feature 3: decreasing orde
geneList = sort(geneList, decreasing = TRUE)
```


## No gene can be mapped
